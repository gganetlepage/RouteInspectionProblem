x²# Exercise
We want to define the road of 10 vehicles in order to cross the whole city of Paris at the fastest way.
We assume that vehicles can be placed everywhere in the city.

# Objectives
- The inputs are available in file "paris_map.txt"
Format: it contains lines with 2 elements (vertices) and some with 3 elements (edges). Vertices includes point latitude and longitude, edges includes the departure vertice index, the arrival vertice index and distance between these 2 points.
A model is available in code "main.py", in parsing function.
- The function "main.py" includes as well a chart in order to view defined edges and vertices. To execute this function do "python main.py paris_map.txt nb" with nb the vertices and edges number to view.
The note "#E=17958, #V=11348, V index from 0 to 11347" gives vertices and edges number in the example.
- This problem is related to chinese postman. Each node represents an intersection and each street is an edge joining 2 intersections. We aim to cross all graph edges with 10 vehicles.  
- Do not hesitate to ask questions if needed (samir@padam.io)

Good luck !
